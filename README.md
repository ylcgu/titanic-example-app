# Titanic Example App

I created this simple app as a baseline example of how to incorporate `pandas` and `dash` with `heroku`.

You can view the finished app here: https://my-test-pandas-app-123.herokuapp.com/

I wrote this medium post to explain deployment: https://medium.com/@austinlasseter/how-to-deploy-a-simple-plotly-dash-app-to-heroku-622a2216eb73
